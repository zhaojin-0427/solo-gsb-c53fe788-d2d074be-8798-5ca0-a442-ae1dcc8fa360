"""Deterministic fault-injection gates for concurrency regression verification.

Disabled unless ``KEYVAULT_FAULT_INJECTION=1`` **and** the request carries the
matching test headers; in a normal deployment every call is a constant-time
no-op. The gates let the regression harness (``scripts/race_recovery.py``)
pin the exact interleaving that previously corrupted ``/recoveries/shares``:

* one request parked **while holding the session row lock** after its verified
  shard entered the in-memory pool (another request is then queued on the lock);
* that request failing from the audit-write / reconstruction path;
* a second request parked right after it acquires the released lock — i.e. at
  the precise point where, in the buggy build, it could observe the first
  request's uncommitted in-memory share, or replace it and have a stale rollback
  delete the newer share.

Gate names used by the share-submit flow:

* ``submit.after_add``   — after the verified shard was put in the pending
                          pool, still inside the transaction, row lock held.
* ``submit.abort_undo`` — on the exception path, **after** this request's own
                          in-memory insertion was retracted but still inside
                          the transaction (the row lock is not yet released).
* ``submit.after_lock`` — immediately after acquiring the session row lock.
* ``submit.before_reconstruct`` — threshold reached, right before combining.

The same gates exist for the cross-policy migration share flow under the
``migration.*`` prefix (``migration.after_lock`` / ``migration.after_add`` /
``migration.before_resplit``), pinning the identical rollback/lock interleaving
on in-memory source-shard accumulation and target re-sharding.
``scripts/race_migration.py`` additionally parks a threshold-reaching submit at
``migration.before_resplit`` (row lock held, pending shares lost) while a
second submitter queues on the lock, proving the queued request can only fail
fast with ``MIGRATION_FAILED`` once the gap detector commits the ``failed``
terminal state — never complete the doomed session.

Logical-destruction interleavings (v1.6, ``scripts/race_destruction.py``) add:

* ``destruction.after_lineage_lock`` — after every custody row of the migration
  lineage is locked but before the in-flight recovery/migration session rows are
  locked. A request parked here lets a migration-completing share submit or a
  recovery shard claim queue on its locks, pinning the deterministic ordering of
  destruction versus in-flight recovery/migration and proving the queued, older
  session can no longer hand out shard plaintext / wrapped ciphertext nor insert
  a missed descendant once destruction wins.
* ``destruction.after_receipt_check`` — after the idempotency-keyed receipt
  pre-check found no existing receipt but before lineage expansion. Two
  concurrent requests reusing one ``Idempotency-Key`` for **unrelated** roots
  park here together (their root row locks do not overlap), so both pass the
  pre-check and the later receipt insert hits ``uq_destruction_idem`` — pinning
  the exact interleaving that used to surface as an unhandled database error,
  and proving the loser now gets a deterministic ``IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`` (409)
  with its lineage destruction / shard deletion / session blocking / completion
  audit fully rolled back. ``X-Fault-Fail: destruction.after_receipt_check:RAISE``
  additionally proves a generic mid-transaction failure is *not* misreported as
  an idempotency conflict.

Migration-session creation (v1.7, ``scripts.race_migration_start.py``) adds:

* ``migration.after_idem_check`` — after every migration pre-check (idempotency
  lookup, source/target validity, per-source open-session blocker) found no
  blocker, but before the session insert. Two concurrent requests reusing one
  ``Idempotency-Key`` for **two different valid source custody records** park
  here together (their source custody row locks do not overlap), both pass the
  pre-check, and the later session insert hits ``uq_migration_idem_open`` —
  pinning the exact interleaving whose 23505 used to be re-raised as an
  unhandled database error with no denial audit. ``X-Fault-Fail`` values
  ``:RAISE`` and ``:UNIQUE:<non-target-constraint>`` at the same gate prove
  other failures are never misread as that conflict.
* ``migration.after_insert_conflict`` — after the loser's session insert hit
  ``uq_migration_idem_open`` and the savepoint rolled back, but **before** the
  committed winner is re-read. Parking the loser here while the winner's
  session is driven ``open`` → ``completed`` (real custodian share submits)
  or into a terminal state pins the completed-winner race: the re-read must
  adjudicate the committed winner by source custody + target policy version
  (same body → 200 replay, different body → 409 ``IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`` with
  a separate denial audit), and a winner that reached a terminal state
  (``expired``/``failed``/``destroyed``) must not win — the creation is
  re-validated under the post-terminal rebuild rules instead of leaking the
  raw database exception.
* ``migration.before_rebuild_revalidate`` — on the bounded rebuild retry
  (post-terminal winner), after the savepoint rolled back and the conflict
  re-read chose rebuild, but **before** source/target are re-locked and
  revalidated. At this point the request holds only the outer source-custody
  row lock (the policy ``FOR UPDATE`` locks lived inside the rolled-back
  savepoint), so pinning here lets a real target-policy revoke / epoch expiry
  commit first and proves the rebuild rejects with a fresh
  ``clock_timestamp()`` instead of reusing the stale pre-wait policy/time.
* ``migration.before_rebuild_insert`` — on the rebuild retry, after
  revalidation + live-winner/source-blocker checks pass but before the INSERT.
  Pinning here lets a *fresh* open/completed winner appear (or be completed)
  under the same key, and ``X-Fault-Fail`` here injects a rebuild-INSERT
  generic / non-target-23505 failure that must surface as a raw 500.

Recovery-freeze interleavings (v1.8, ``scripts/race_freeze.py``) add:

* ``freeze.after_root_lock`` — after the freeze root custody row is locked
  (tenant / destroyed checks done) but before the fixed-point lineage
  expansion. Pinning here with a threshold migration submit or a recovery
  shard claim running concurrently pins the deterministic custody-lock
  ordering: a migration that completes first produces a descendant the next
  expansion round must include (the freeze never misses a future descendant),
  while a recovery gate queued on the lock can only receive CUSTODY_FROZEN
  after the freeze commits — no nonce spent, no shard plaintext or one-time
  ciphertext emitted.
* ``freeze.after_lineage_lock`` — after every lineage custody row is locked
  but before the freeze row is inserted. A queued recovery-create / nonce /
  claim / submit still blocks on the custody locks at this point and observes
  the freeze the moment it commits; releasing the gate commits the freeze.

Each gate is a fresh reached/release event pair per park cycle, so a request
that lists several sequentially-visited gates cannot have one release fall
through into a later listed gate.

Header protocol (only honored when fault injection is enabled):

* ``X-Fault-Gate: <name>``        park at that gate until released
* ``X-Fault-Fail: <name>:<code>`` at that gate raise ``ApiError(code)`` before
                                  parking (used with a gate name that is
                                  visited by the same request; the harness
                                  typically pairs fail-at after_add with
                                  park-at abort_undo).
* ``X-Fault-Fail: <name>:UNIQUE:<constraint>`` raises an
  ``asyncpg.UniqueViolationError`` (SQLSTATE 23505) tagged with the given
  ``constraint_name`` — used to prove that a 23505 from a *non-target*
  constraint is never misclassified as an idempotency / migration conflict.
